Overview
========

Kinbaku is a very fast and free graph database distributed using the MIT License. The package is still under heavy development and not production-ready yet.

Who is this package for ?
-------------------------

This package is designed for students, researchers or developers who want to create, save and modify huge networks and graphs.

Goals
-----

Despite the fact that loading a huge graph into RAM is impossible for most modern computers, this is the only possibility offered by popular Python-based graph management packages like Networkx or igraph. On the other hand, setting up and running a graph-oriented database like Neo4J can be complex, overkill and makes the data harder to share. Kinbaku does not make any compromise: it allows the creation of huge graphs (tested up to several hundreds of millions of nodes) and with a speed unequalled even by the fastest graph oriented databases (see benchmark). All this in a single file.
