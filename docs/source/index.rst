Kinbaku is a graph database written in pure Python, made for storing, updating and accessing large graphs directly on disk.
It has many useful features such as:

-  storage of directed graphs with custom node or edge attributes
-  painless navigation in graphs using powerful yet simple queries
-  RAM-friendly algorithms and tools
-  multiprocessing support

Kinbaku deliberately follows NetworkX syntax as close as possible, making it both simple and familiar to use.
